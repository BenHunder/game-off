General:
git status //you can use this in between every command 
git stash //erase unstaged changes (changes you’ve made since the last pull)

New feature:
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
*make changes*
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
git add .
git commit -m “description of my new features”
git push origin <new-branch-name>

Then you can create a pull request from <new-branch-name> to dev within the Github UI
